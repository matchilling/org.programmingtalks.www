As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law.\\n\\nOf course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is \\\"the Way\\\".\\n\\nDr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9.\\n\\nThis video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation. Of course, you can't just cover monads in a vacuum (category theory is not really addressed here) so the context is functional programming (Brian covers functions and composable functional structures (function chains) and of course monoids and then monads).\\n\\nTune in.

This session explores solutions to several of the common challenges that AngularJS developers face while building business applications.\\\"\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H1M27S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"UlvCbnKAH3g\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"john-papa-10-angularjs-patterns-code-on-the-beach-2014\",\"tag\":[\"John Papa\",\"AngularJS (Software)\",\"Beach\",\"JavaScript\",\"Single Page Apps\",\"Patterns\",\"Code on the Beach\",\"conference\",\"Software Engineering (Industry)\",\"Software Development (Industry)\",\"Software Design Pattern (Field Of Study)\",\"Programming Language\",\"programming\",\"Jacksonville (City/Town/Village)\",\"Florida (US State)\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UlvCbnKAH3g/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"John Papa - 10 AngularJS Patterns - Code on the Beach 2014\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"If you always wanted to know more about about Clang's AST [1], for example because you want to implement an awesome tool [2, 3] based on Clang, or simply because you want to start contributing, this talk is for you.\\n\\nMake sure to watch in HD to be able to read the font in the terminal!\\n\\nThe semantic code completion in the vim session is powered by YCM [4], and the quick formatting is done by clang-format [5].\\n\\n[1] http://clang.llvm.org/docs/IntroductionToTheClangAST.html\\n[2] http://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html\\n[3] http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibTooling.html\\n[4] https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe\\n[5] http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html\\n\\nFrom the LLVM Euro Conference 2013: http://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-04/\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT44M53S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"VqCkCDFLSsc\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"the-clang-ast-a-tutorial\",\"tag\":[\"C++\",\"Clang\",\"compiler\",\"programming\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VqCkCDFLSsc/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"The Clang AST - a Tutorial\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Cross posted from msdn's channel 9.\\n\\nFunctional programming is increasing in popularity these days given the inherent problems with shared mutable state that is rife in the imperative world. As we march on to a world of multi and many-core chipsets, software engineering must evolve to better equip software engineers with the tools to exploit the vast power of multiple core processors as it won't come for free as it did in the recent past which was predictably based on Moore's law.\\n\\nOf course, learning new ways to think about programming semantics and code patterns are not always straight forward. For example, most imperative programmers (which include most of us who build software for a living...) are somewhat perplexed by the notion of functions as first class data structures that can be combined to create powerful and composable systems. Languages like Haskell are pure functional languages and require programmers to think in a different way, often in a precise mathematical fashion where composing and chaining functions is \\\"the Way\\\".\\n\\nDr. Brian Beckman, a Channel 9 celebrity, astrophysicist and senior software engineer thought it would be a very good idea to address the complexity of monads in an easy to understand way: a technical conversation at the whiteboard with yours truly for Channel 9.\\n\\nThis video interview is the result of Brian's idea that he can in fact remove the fear of monads from anybody who pays attention to his explanation. Of course, you can't just cover monads in a vacuum (category theory is not really addressed here) so the context is functional programming (Brian covers functions and composable functional structures (function chains) and of course monoids and then monads).\\n\\nTune in. There's a lot to learn here and only Brian can make monads easy to understand for the rest of us!\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT1H7M11S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"ZhuHCtR3xq8\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"brian-beckman-dont-fear-the-monad\",\"tag\":[\"haskell\",\"monads\",\"programming\",\"brian beckman\",\"functional programming\",\"Haskell\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZhuHCtR3xq8/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Brian Beckman: Don't fear the Monad\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"Help us caption & translate this video!\\n\\nhttp://amara.org/v/FGYe/\",\"meta\":{\"duration\":\"PT59M32S\"},\"presenter\":{\"name\":null},\"source\":{\"id\":\"aZXc11eOEpI\",\"provider\":\"youtube\"},\"slug\":\"elixir-conf-2014-keynote-elixir-by-jose-valim\",\"tag\":[\"computer science\",\"technology\",\"elixir\",\"apps\",\"programming\",\"mobile\"],\"thumbnails\":{\"default\":{\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZXc11eOEpI/default.jpg\",\"height\":90,\"width\":120}},\"title\":\"Elixir Conf 2014 - Keynote: Elixir by Jose Valim\"}},{\"node\":{\"description\":\"This talk is part of Cerner's Tech Talk series.

But the real impact from advanced analytics comes from building models that make real-time decisions within production workflows. We will discuss how to use the ecosystem of technologies around Hadoop to support bringing models out of the lab and into the factory, with a focus on strategies for data integration, large-scale machine learning, and experimentation.\\n\\nAbout the Speaker:\\nJosh Wills (@josh_wills) is the Senior Director of Data Science at Cloudera, a leading distrubtor of Hadoop and related services.
