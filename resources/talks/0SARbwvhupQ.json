    "description": "Google I/O 2009 - The Myth of the Genius Programmer\r\n\r\nBrian Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman\r\n\r\nA pervasive elitism hovers in the background of collaborative software development:  everyone secretly wants to be seen as a genius.  In this talk, we discuss how to avoid this trap and gracefully exchange personal ego for personal growth and super-charged collaboration.  We'll also examine how software tools affect social behaviors, and how to successfully manage the growth of new ideas.\r\n\r\nFor presentation slides and all I/O sessions, please go to: code.google.com/events/io/sessions.html",
