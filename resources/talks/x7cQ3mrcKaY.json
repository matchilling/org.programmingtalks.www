{"description":"Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/floydophone/react-preso-v2\nReact, the new open-source JS library from Facebook and Instagram, is a different way to write JavaScript apps. When it was introduced at JSConf US in May, the audience was shocked by some of its design principles. One sarcastic tweet from an audience member ended up describing React's philosophy quite accurately: https://twitter.com/cowboy/status/339858717451362304\n\nAt Facebook and Instagram, we're trying to push the limits of what's possible on the web with React. My talk will start with a brief introduction to the framework, and then dive into three controversial topics: Throwing out the notion of templates and building views with JavaScript, \"re-rendering\" your entire application when your data changes, and a lightweight implementation of the DOM and events.\n\n\nLicense: For reuse of this video under a more permissive license please get in touch with us.
