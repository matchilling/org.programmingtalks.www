{"description":"This presentation will introduce a new start-up focused on machine learning that is using Clojure. We will discuss the technology and architecture it has developed for real-time machine learning and pattern recognition, and how Clojure provides a unique set of advantages.\n\nThere will be a live coding demonstration of interactively applying machine learning to a simple task and visualization of the results.","id":"ef8a9908-bc51-4e88-a390-7a7109bd383c","meta":{"duration":"PT27M38S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"machine-learning-live-mike-anderson","source":{"id":"QJ1qgCr09j8","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["clojure"],"title":"Machine Learning Live - Mike Anderson","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJ1qgCr09j8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJ1qgCr09j8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QJ1qgCr09j8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}}
