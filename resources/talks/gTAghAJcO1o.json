    "description": "When thinking about the future, you can't do better than Alan Kay. In The Future Doesn't Have To Be Incremental, Kay describes how Xerox PARC was able to develop so many new technologies in such a short time, including the personal computer, bitmap displays, GUI, desktop publishing, word processing, laser printing, Ethernet, and object oriented programming. The key was a culture focused on invention - that is, fundamentally new research - instead of incremental innovation. Invention requires a significantly higher investment of money, much longer time frames, and a different approach to problem solving.",
