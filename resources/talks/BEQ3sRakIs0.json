{"description":"Presenter(s): Rusty Russell\nURL: http://2011.linux.conf.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/190\n\nWhile working on CCAN I realised just how many C coding tricks there are.  Regrettably, we spend very little time reading completely foreign code and instead we collect techniques one by one over years.\r\n\r\nIt needn't be that way: this presentation is a cookbook with examples of all the C programming tricks I have found value in.  Not just the basics like valgrind, talloc and the Jenkins hash, but less sane techniques like typesafe callbacks, runtime code updating, C as a scripting language and malloc failure path testing.\r\n\r\nEveryone who codes in C will get something out of this talk.\n\nhttp://2011.linux.conf.au/ - http://www.linux.org.au\nCC BY-SA - http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.txt","id":"09736179-2ec3-4b7b-ad26-5bf6a39d3220","meta":{"duration":"PT46M53S"},"presenter":{"name":null},"slug":"advanced-c-coding-for-fun","source":{"id":"BEQ3sRakIs0","provider":"youtube"},"tag":["LCA2011","Linux","Open Source"],"title":"Advanced C Coding For Fun!","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BEQ3sRakIs0/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}}}
